# Assignment: Predicting Future Outcomes

This is the scenario as outlined in the assignment briefing: 

> You are part of a team of data analysts that was contracted by Turtle Games, a game manufacturer and retailer with a global customer base. The company manufactures and sells its own products, along with sourcing and selling products manufactured by other companies. Its product range includes books, board games, video games, and toys. The company collects data from sales as well as customer reviews. Turtle Games has a business objective of improving overall sales performance by utilising customer trends.  

> To improve overall sales performance, Turtle Games has come up with an initial set of questions: 
> * How do customers engage with and accumulate loyalty points?
> * How can customers can be segmented into groups, and which groups can be targeted by the marketing department? 
> * How can text data (e.g. social data such as customer reviews) be used to inform marketing campaigns and make improvements to the business?
> * What trends and insights can be identified from the sales data?
> * Is the sales data suitable for modelling purposes? (Provide a statistical review and interpretation (e.g. normal distribution, skewness, or kurtosis) to justify the answer.)
> * Are there any possible relationships between North American, European, and global sales? (If yes, please provide a description.)
