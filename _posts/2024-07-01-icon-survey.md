**Background** <br><br>
ICON College is an independent College of Higher Education in Central London. As a degree-awarding institution, they are required to submit an Access and Participation Plan to the Office for Students each year; and have committed to surveying their students on an annual basis to gain insight into all aspects of their experience, with a particular focus on understanding the experiences of students from ethnic minorities and those with disabilities. 

**Goals** <br><br>
To analyse the surveys and create a dashboard that could be used by ICON management to delve into the data.

**The data** <br><br>
Responses to 90 survey questions by 260 undergraduate students.

**Analysis** <br><br>
I cleaned the data using Excel and Python, then used Tableau to create an interactive dashboard for each over-arching questions of the survey.
