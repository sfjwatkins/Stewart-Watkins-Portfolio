  <p> I am a data analyst based in Brighton, UK- nice to meet you! <br><br>
    
    A problem-solver, strategic thinker and specialist at getting to the heart of an issue, I love deriving actionable insights from data to help inform business decisions. <br><br>

    I use a range of technical skills (Python, R, SQL, Tableau, Excel) to explore, analyse and visualize data, drawing on my training as a social scientist (BSC in Psychology, MSc in Research Methods at Birkbeck) and data analyst (the London School of Economics Career Accelerator). With years of senior operational leadership experience in the education sector, I am adept at communicating effectively to key stakeholders, with a keen focus on the issue at hand. <br><br>
    
   Please check out some of my latest projects and get in touch with me here. I look forward to hearing from you!

  <p> The rest of this paragraph is filler for the sake of seeing the text wrap around the 150×150 image, which is **left aligned**. As you can see there should be some space above, below, and to the right of the image. The text should not be creeping on the image. Creeping is just not right. Let them speak like you words. Let them do their jobs without any hassle from the text. In about one more sentence here, we'll see that the text moves from the right of the image down below the image in seamless transition. Again, letting the do it's thing. Mission accomplished! The rest of this paragraph is filler for the sake of seeing the text wrap around the 150×150 image, which is **left aligned**.
