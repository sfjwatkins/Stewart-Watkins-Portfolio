  <p> I am a data analyst based in Brighton, UK- nice to meet you! <br><br>
    Drawing on years of management experience in the education sector (FE, HE, language travel), I am a problem-solver, strategic thinker and specialist at getting to the heart of an issue and identifying actionable insights. My approach is underpinned by my training as a social scientist (BSC in Psychology, MSc in Research Methods) and, more recently, the technical training I received on the London School of Economics Career Accelerator. <br><br>

  <p> The rest of this paragraph is filler for the sake of seeing the text wrap around the 150×150 image, which is **left aligned**. As you can see there should be some space above, below, and to the right of the image. The text should not be creeping on the image. Creeping is just not right. Let them speak like you words. Let them do their jobs without any hassle from the text. In about one more sentence here, we'll see that the text moves from the right of the image down below the image in seamless transition. Again, letting the do it's thing. Mission accomplished! The rest of this paragraph is filler for the sake of seeing the text wrap around the 150×150 image, which is **left aligned**. As you can see there should be some space above, below, and to the right of the image. The text should not be creeping on the image. Creeping is just not right. </p>
